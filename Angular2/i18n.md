1. Mark static text messages in your component templates for translation.
2. An angular i18n tool extracts the marked messages into an industry standard translation source file.
3. A translator edits that file, translating the extracted text messages into the target language, and returns the file to you.
4. The angular compiler imports the completed translation files, replaces the original messages with translated text, and generates a new version of the application in the target language.

**IMPORTANT**
Using the built in angular i18n support, you need to build and deploy a separate version of the application for each supported language. *I don't know why the documentation says this. It isn't really accurate. The correct version of the app is compiled at run-time on the browser. If using AOT, then yes. That makes sense.*
